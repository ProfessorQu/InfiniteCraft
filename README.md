# InfiniteCraft

## How it works

This mod adds infinite recipes!
Everytime you try a recipe that is not present in the vanilla game this mod will create a random output.

## Items

The random item can be anything from a few wooden planks to a stack of diamond blocks!
Non-stackable items will also get random attribute boosts and enchantments.
Then you can combine these items in the Combiner to make them even more powerful.

## Combiner

The Combiner has a very simple GUI that resembles that of an anvil.
You input two items and combine them into the first, with the additions of the second.
The Combiner is crafted with a dragon egg, two diamond blocks and 4 obsidian in a similar shape to an enchanting table.
